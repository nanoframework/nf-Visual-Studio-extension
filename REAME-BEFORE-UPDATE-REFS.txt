## Developer Notes

!! Be extremely careful when updating NuGet packages !!
We are pushing the limits of the VS extensibility SDK, and it's very easy to break things. In particular, the most critical symptom to check for with each package update is the ability to start a debug session.
On failure, a CompositionException is usually silently thrown, and the debugger refuses to start without any further clue on what is wrong.
